# 🔧 Statistics Tracking Fix

## Problem
After applying the performance optimization migration (`20250202000004_optimize_performance_warnings.sql`), games stopped tracking statistics and XP properly.

## Root Causes
1. **Function Overloading Conflict** - Multiple versions of `update_user_level_stats` function caused API conflicts
2. **Missing INSERT Policies** - The optimization migration removed critical INSERT permissions for `user_level_stats`
3. **Missing SERVICE_ROLE Access** - Edge Functions lost access to key tables for bet processing
4. **Gaming Table Permission Gaps** - Roulette, Tower, and other game tables missing service role policies

## Solution
The fix is provided in: `supabase/migrations/20250103000001_fix_statistics_tracking_after_performance_migration.sql`

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Via Supabase SQL Editor (Immediate Fix)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250103000001_fix_statistics_tracking_after_performance_migration.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor and click "Run"

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI (Proper Migration)
```bash
supabase db push
```

## What the Fix Does

✅ **Resolves Function Overloading** - Drops all conflicting versions and creates one clean `update_user_level_stats` function  
✅ **Restores INSERT Permissions** - Adds missing policies for `user_level_stats`, `game_history`, etc.  
✅ **Grants Service Role Access** - Edge Functions can now access all required tables  
✅ **Fixes Gaming Table Policies** - Roulette, Tower, Coinflip games can track stats  
✅ **Ensures Required Functions Exist** - `calculate_level_from_xp`, `atomic_bet_balance_check`  
✅ **Tests the Fix** - Includes validation to confirm everything works  

## Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ All games will track statistics and XP again
- ✅ User levels will update properly  
- ✅ Wagering amounts will be recorded
- ✅ Game win/loss ratios will be tracked
- ✅ Live bet feeds will work
- ✅ Balance updates will be atomic

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see these success messages in the SQL logs:
```
✅ Statistics tracking function is working properly
🎯 Statistics tracking permissions have been restored!
📊 All game engines should now properly track stats and XP  
🔧 Edge Functions have service_role access to all required tables
🎲 Roulette, Tower, and Coinflip games can now process bets and update stats
🛡️ Function overloading issues have been resolved
```

## Testing

Place a test bet in any game (Roulette, Tower, or Coinflip) and verify:
1. User XP increases
2. Game statistics update
3. Wagering amounts are tracked
4. No function overloading errors in logs

The fix maintains all performance optimizations while restoring full functionality.
