# REACT COMPONENT UPDATES NEEDED

The following React components have been updated:

1. **AdminPanel.tsx** - Enhanced deleteUserAccount function
2. **AccountDeletionHandler.tsx** - Full-screen site lock overlay
3. **Database migrations** - Added pending_account_deletions table

These changes implement:
- Server-side scheduled deletion with 30-second delay
- Full-screen site lock with countdown timer
- Offline-capable deletion processing
- Comprehensive audit trail
