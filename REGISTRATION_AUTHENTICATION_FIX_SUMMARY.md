# Registration and Authentication Fix Summary

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20250127000037_comprehensive-registration-authentication-fix.sql`

## üö® Issues Identified

Your registration and authentication system had several critical issues:

### 1. **Inconsistent RLS Policies**
- Multiple migration files created conflicting Row Level Security policies
- Policies were being dropped and recreated inconsistently
- Some policies were too restrictive, causing 406 errors
- Others were too permissive, creating security concerns

### 2. **Schema Mismatches**
- The `profiles` table was missing columns (`available_cases`, `total_cases_opened`, `email`, `last_seen`)
- The `handle_new_user` trigger function was trying to insert into non-existent columns
- The `user_level_stats` table structure was inconsistent across migrations

### 3. **Trigger Function Issues**
- Multiple versions of `handle_new_user` function with different implementations
- Poor error handling causing registration failures
- Missing comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. **AuthContext Complexity**
- Overly complex fallback mechanisms in registration flow
- Multiple attempts at profile creation causing race conditions
- Inconsistent error handling and logging

## üîß Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. **Database Schema Standardization**

#### Profiles Table
```sql
-- Added missing columns
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS available_cases INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_cases_opened INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_seen TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now();
```

#### User Level Stats Table
- Ensured comprehensive table structure with all game statistics
- Added proper foreign key constraints
- Included all necessary columns for the leveling system

#### Admin Users Table
- Created standardized admin users table
- Added proper role and permissions structure

### 2. **RLS Policies Cleanup and Standardization**

#### Complete Policy Reset
```sql
-- Dynamically dropped ALL existing policies for consistency
FOR policy_record IN 
  SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles' AND schemaname = 'public'
LOOP
  EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON public.profiles', policy_record.policyname);
END LOOP;
```

#### New Consistent Policies

**Profiles Table:**
- `profiles_select_authenticated`: All authenticated users can view all profiles (for leaderboards)
- `profiles_update_own`: Users can update their own profile
- `profiles_insert_own`: Users can insert their own profile
- `profiles_service_role_all`: Service role has full access

**User Level Stats Table:**
- `user_level_stats_select_authenticated`: All authenticated users can view all stats
- `user_level_stats_update_own`: Users can update their own stats
- `user_level_stats_insert_own`: Users can insert their own stats
- `user_level_stats_service_role_all`: Service role has full access

**Admin Users Table:**
- `admin_users_select_authenticated`: All authenticated users can view admin status
- `admin_users_service_role_all`: Service role has full access

### 3. **Robust Trigger Function**

#### New `handle_new_user()` Function Features:
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Each operation wrapped in try-catch blocks
- **Detailed Logging**: Extensive RAISE NOTICE statements for debugging
- **Graceful Failure**: Continues execution even if individual operations fail
- **Proper Schema Alignment**: Inserts into all required columns
- **Duplicate Handling**: Handles unique constraint violations gracefully

```sql
-- Extract user data
username_text := COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'username', 'User_' || substr(NEW.id::text, 1, 8));
user_email := NEW.email;

-- Create profile with comprehensive error handling
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (
    id, username, email, registration_date, balance, level, xp,
    total_wagered, total_profit, last_claim_time, badges,
    available_cases, total_cases_opened, last_seen, created_at, updated_at
  ) VALUES (
    NEW.id, username_text, user_email, NEW.created_at, 0, 1, 0,
    0, 0, '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z', ARRAY['welcome'],
    0, 0, NEW.created_at, NEW.created_at, NEW.created_at
  );
  
  profile_created := TRUE;
  RAISE NOTICE '[REGISTRATION] ‚úÖ Profile created successfully for user %', NEW.id;
  
EXCEPTION
  WHEN unique_violation THEN
    RAISE NOTICE '[REGISTRATION] ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile already exists for user %', NEW.id;
    profile_created := TRUE;
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS error_message = MESSAGE_TEXT;
    RAISE WARNING '[REGISTRATION] ‚ùå Profile creation failed for user %: %', NEW.id, error_message;
    profile_created := FALSE;
END;
```

### 4. **Helper Functions for Manual Operations**

#### `create_user_profile_manual(UUID, TEXT)`
- Used by AuthContext as fallback
- Returns JSONB with success/error status
- Handles all edge cases

#### `ensure_user_level_stats(UUID)`
- Ensures user level stats exist
- Safe to call multiple times
- Returns detailed status information

### 5. **Streamlined AuthContext**

#### Removed Complex Fallbacks
- Simplified registration flow
- Removed multiple fallback attempts
- Trust database trigger for primary profile creation
- Only use manual creation for genuine edge cases

#### Better Error Handling
```typescript
// Only attempt manual creation if it's a genuine missing profile issue
if (profileError.code === 'PGRST116') { // No rows returned
  console.log('üîß Attempting manual profile creation as fallback...')
  // ... manual creation logic
}
```

#### Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive console logging
- Clear status indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Better error categorization

### 6. **Proper Permissions**

```sql
-- Grant table permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON public.profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON public.user_level_stats TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.admin_users TO authenticated;

-- Grant function permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.create_user_profile_manual(UUID, TEXT) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.ensure_user_level_stats(UUID) TO authenticated;
```

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing

The migration includes built-in testing that verifies:

1. **Trigger Function**: Creates test user and verifies profile/stats creation
2. **Query Permissions**: Tests all table access permissions
3. **Manual Functions**: Verifies helper functions work correctly
4. **Policy Effectiveness**: Ensures RLS policies allow proper access

## üöÄ Expected Results

After applying this fix, your application should experience:

### ‚úÖ **Resolved Issues**
- **No more 406 errors** during registration or login
- **Consistent profile creation** for all new users
- **Reliable user level stats** initialization
- **Proper admin status checks** without errors
- **Clean, consistent RLS policies** across all tables

### ‚úÖ **Improved Reliability**
- **Robust error handling** in trigger functions
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
- **Graceful failure recovery** mechanisms
- **Consistent database schema** across all environments

### ‚úÖ **Better Performance**
- **Streamlined registration flow** without unnecessary fallbacks
- **Optimized RLS policies** for better query performance
- **Reduced database round trips** during registration

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Apply the migration**: Run the migration file in your Supabase dashboard or CLI
2. **Test registration**: Try registering a new user to verify the fix
3. **Test login**: Verify existing users can still log in properly
4. **Monitor logs**: Check the database logs for the detailed registration logging
5. **Clean up**: Remove old migration files that are now superseded (optional)

## üîç Monitoring

The new system includes extensive logging. Look for these log patterns:

```
[REGISTRATION] Starting profile creation for user [UUID] (email: [email], username: [username])
[REGISTRATION] ‚úÖ Profile created successfully for user [UUID]
[REGISTRATION] ‚úÖ User level stats created successfully for user [UUID]
[REGISTRATION] üìä Registration completed for user [UUID]: profile=true, stats=true
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. The migration safely handles existing data
2. All operations use `IF NOT EXISTS` or `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
3. Policies are dropped and recreated, so rollback would require restoring previous policies
4. The trigger function is completely replaced, so you'd need to restore the previous version

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after applying this fix:

1. Check the database logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify the migration completed successfully
3. Test with a fresh user registration
4. Check the RLS policies are correctly applied

This comprehensive fix addresses all the identified issues and should resolve your registration and authentication problems permanently.
